This paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of contracting Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), when applied to MBL Hamiltonians. We prove that while the exact contraction is #P-complete, approximate contraction schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation exhibit polynomial time complexity with bounded error for short-time evolution. However, we identify a "complexity phase transition" at the ergodic-MBL transition point, where the bond dimension required for a fixed accuracy diverges exponentially. We propose a novel adaptive bond-dimension algorithm that optimizes computational resources by exploiting the area law of entanglement in the localized phase, demonstrating superior performance on Heisenberg spin chains.},

This study employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase transitions of the 2D Ising model mapped onto hyperbolic lattices (Poincaré disk).

}1b:T613,Efficient recognition of emotions has attracted extensive research interest, which makes new applications in many fields possible, such as human-computer interaction, disease diagnosis, service robots, and so forth. Although existing work on sentiment analysis relying on sensors or unimodal methods performs well for simple contexts like business recommendation and facial expression recognition, it does far below expectations for complex scenes, such as sarcasm, disdain, and metaphors. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage multimodal learning framework, called AMSA, to adaptively learn correlation and complementarity between modalities for dynamic fusion, achieving more stable and precise sentiment analysis results. Specifically, a multiscale attention model with a slice positioning scheme is proposed to get stable quintuplets of sentiment in images, texts, and speeches in the first stage. Then a Transformer-based self-adaptive network is proposed to assign weights flexibly for multimodal fusion in the second stage and update the parameters of the loss function through compensation iteration. To quickly locate key areas for efficient affective computing, a patch-based selection scheme is proposed to iteratively remove redundant information through a novel loss function before fusion. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both machine weakly labeled and manually annotated datasets of self-made Video-SA, CMU-MOSEI, and CMU-MOSI. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach through comparison with baselines.1c:T78d,@article{wang2023amsa,
